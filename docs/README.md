From link: https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/2556/view

### Basics

| Criteria | Specifications |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Parameters  | The more the better, but an exaggerated number of parameters can be messy ( say, 10 or more ). 1 or 0 is definitely lacking.  |
| Resources  | This is the mandatory section of the script, we are looking for a LoadBalancer, Launch Configuration, AutoScaling group a health check, security groups and a Listener and Target Group.  |
| Outputs  | This is optional, but it would be nice to have a URL here with the Load Balancer DNS Name and “http” in front of it.  |
| Working Test  | If the student provides a URL to verify his work is running properly, it will be a page that says “it works! Udagram, Udacity”  |

### Load Balancer

| Criteria | Specifications |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Target Group  | The auto-scaling group needs to have a property that associates it with a target group. The Load Balancer will have a Listener rule associated with the same target group  |
| Health Check and Listener  | Port 80 should be used in Security groups, health checks and listeners associated with the load balancer  |

### Auto Scaling

| Criteria | Specifications |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Subnets  | Students should be using PRIV-NET ( private subnets ) for their auto-scaling instances  |
| Machine Specs  | The machine should have 10 GB or more of disk and should be a t3.small or better.  |
| SSH Key  | There shouldn’t be a ‘keyname’ property in the launch config  (except with optional Bastion Host) |

### Bonus

| Criteria | Specifications |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Output  | Any values in the output section are a bonus  |
| Bastion Host  | Any resource of type AWS::EC2::Instance, optional, but nice to have.  |
